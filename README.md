## My process

1. Downloaded Figma files and use its measurements.
2. Make a grouping of components (HTML <div>) and possible classes in CSS for styling
3. Add detailed styling like box-shadow and hover
4. Cleaning the code and putting variables in the `:root` attribute

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Different displays are used in this project, as well as Flexbox layout, and importing fonts directly from file assets.

### Continued development

I will continue to learn Flexbox layouts and displays.

### Useful resources

- [Shadow box generator](https://cssgenerator.pl/en/box-shadow-generator/) - This helped me visualize box-shadows- really helpful tool for beginners trying to pixel perfect a project!
- [HEX converter](https://colordesigner.io/convert/hextohsl) - This is an amazing HEX color converter to HSL. HEX code can be copied directly from Figma.
